## Issue
Thank you for your feedback. When you report a problem, please pay attention to following points:

### Does it happen on web browsers? (especially Chrome)
Mattermost Desktop is based on Electron, which integrates the Chrome engine within a standalone application.
If the problem you encounter can be reproduced on web browsers, it may be an issue with Mattermost server (or Chrome).

### Try "Clear Cache and Reload"
It's available as `Ctrl(Command) + Shift + R`.
Some layout problems are caused by browser cache.
Especially, this kind of issue might happen when you have updated Mattermost server.

### Write detailed information
Detailed information is very helpful to understand the problem.

For example:
* How to reproduce, step-by-step
* Expected behavior (or what is wrong)
* Screenshots (for GUI issues)
* Application version
* Operating system
* Mattermost server version
